Assuming you're on ZSH
```sh
#!/bin/zsh

# Make zsh use word splitting as in bash
setopt sh_word_split
# Store the config files as elements of an array
ConfigFiles=( $(ls <path to directory with the different configs>) )

echo "Choose which prompt you want"

for i in {1..$#ConfigFiles}; do
    echo "[${i}] ${ConfigFiles[$i]}"
done

read choice

# Replace the contents of the starship.toml file with the contents of the chosen prompt
cat <path to directory with the different configs>/${ConfigFiles[choice]} > ~/.config/starship.toml
```
